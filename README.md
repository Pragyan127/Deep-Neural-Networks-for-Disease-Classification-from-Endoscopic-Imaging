# Deep-Neural-Networks-for-Disease-Classification-from-Endoscopic-Imaging
This project uses a U-Net-based CNN for classification and segmentation of gastrointestinal abnormalities from endoscopic images. It achieves high accuracy (98.37%) and uses Grad-CAM for visual interpretability. Built on the Kvasir dataset, it aims to enhance medical diagnostics.
